Abstract: *3D scene representations have gained immense popularity in recent years. Methods that use Neural Radiance fields are versatile for traditional tasks such as novel view synthesis. In recent times, some work has emerged that aims to extend the functionality of NeRF beyond view synthesis, for semantically aware tasks such as editing and segmentation using 3D feature field distillation from 2D foundation models. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines, and (b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts reducing feature quality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown state-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this work, we go one step further: in addition to radiance field rendering, we enable 3D Gaussian splatting on arbitrary-dimension semantic features via 2D foundation model distillation. This translation is not straightforward: naively incorporating feature fields in the 3DGS framework encounters significant challenges, notably the disparities in spatial resolution and channel consistency between RGB images and feature maps. We propose architectural and training changes to efficiently avert this problem. Our proposed method is general, and our experiments showcase novel view semantic segmentation, language-guided editing and segment anything through learning feature fields from state-of-the-art 2D foundation models such as SAM and CLIP-LSeg. Across experiments, our distillation method is able to provide comparable or better results, while being significantly faster to both train and render. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first method to enable point and bounding-box prompting for radiance field manipulation, by leveraging the SAM model.*

# Environment setup
Our default, provided install method is based on Conda package and environment management:
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate feature_3dgs
```


# Processing your own Scenes

We follow the same dataset logistics for [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting). If you want to work with your own scene, put the images you want to use in a directory ```<location>/input```. 
```
<location>
|---input
    |---<image 0>
    |---<image 1>
    |---...
```
For rasterization, the camera models must be either a SIMPLE_PINHOLE or PINHOLE camera. We provide a converter script ```convert.py```, to extract undistorted images and SfM information from input images. Optionally, you can use ImageMagick to resize the undistorted images. This rescaling is similar to MipNeRF360, i.e., it creates images with 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 the original resolution in corresponding folders. To use them, please first install a recent version of COLMAP (ideally CUDA-powered) and ImageMagick.

If you have COLMAP and ImageMagick on your system path, you can simply run 
```shell
python convert.py -s <location> [--resize] #If not resizing, ImageMagick is not needed
```

Our COLMAP loaders expect the following dataset structure in the source path location:

```
<location>
|---images
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---sparse
    |---0
        |---cameras.bin
        |---images.bin
        |---points3D.bin
```

Alternatively, you can use the optional parameters ```--colmap_executable``` and ```--magick_executable``` to point to the respective paths. Please note that on Windows, the executable should point to the COLMAP ```.bat``` file that takes care of setting the execution environment. Once done, ```<location>``` will contain the expected COLMAP data set structure with undistorted, resized input images, in addition to your original images and some temporary (distorted) data in the directory ```distorted```.

If you have your own COLMAP dataset without undistortion (e.g., using ```OPENCV``` camera), you can try to just run the last part of the script: Put the images in ```input``` and the COLMAP info in a subdirectory ```distorted```:
```
<location>
|---input
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---distorted
    |---database.db
    |---sparse
        |---0
            |---...
```
Then run 
```shell
python convert.py -s <location> --skip_matching [--resize] #If not resizing, ImageMagick is not needed
```

# Feature Encoding from Teacher Network

## LSeg encoder

### Installation
Setup LSeg
```
cd encoders/lseg_encoder
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/zhanghang1989/PyTorch-Encoding/
```

Download the LSeg model file `demo_e200.ckpt` from [the Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ayk6NXURI_vIPlym16f_RG3ffxBWHxvb/view?usp=sharing).

### Feature embedding
```
python -u encode_images.py --backbone clip_vitl16_384 --weights demo_e200.ckpt --widehead --no-scaleinv --outdir ../../data/DATASET_NAME/rgb_feature_langseg --test-rgb-dir ../../data/DATASET_NAME/images --workers 0
```
This may produces large feature map files in `--outdir` (100-200MB per file).

Run train.py. If reconstruction fails, change `--scale 4.0` to smaller or larger values, e.g., `--scale 1.0` or `--scale 16.0`.





## SAM encoder

### Installation

The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

SAM setup:
```
cd encoders/sam_encoder
pip install -e .
```

Pretrain model download:

Click the links below to download the checkpoint for the corresponding model type.

- **`default` or `vit_h`: [ViT-H SAM model.](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth)**
- `vit_l`: [ViT-L SAM model.](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_l_0b3195.pth)
- `vit_b`: [ViT-B SAM model.](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth)

And place it at the folder: ```
encoders/sam_encoder/checkpoints```

The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx
```

### Feature embedding
Run the following to export the image embeddings of an input image or directory of images.
```
python export_image_embeddings.py --checkpoint checkpoints/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth --model-type vit_h --input ../../data/DATASET_NAME/images  --output ../../data/OUTPUT_NAME/sam_embeddings
```

### Gaussian Rasterization with High-dimensional Features
You can customize `NUM_SEMANTIC_CHANNELS` in `submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization/cuda_rasterizer/config.h` for any number of feature dimension that you want: 

- Customize `NUM_SEMANTIC_CHANNELS` in `config.h`.

If you would like to use the optional CNN speed-up module, do the following accordingly:

- Customize `NUMBER` in `semantic_feature_size/NUMBER` in `scene/gaussian_model.py` in line 142.
- Customize `NUMBER` in `feature_out_dim/NUMBER` in `train.py` in line 51.
- Customize `NUMBER` in `feature_out_dim/NUMBER` in `render.py` in line 116 and 246. 

where `feature_out_dim` / `NUMBER` = `NUM_SEMANTIC_CHANNELS`. The `feature_out_dim` matches the ground truth foundation model dimensions, 512 for LSeg and 256 for SAM. The default `NUMBER = 2`. For your reference, here are 4 configurations of runing `train.py`:

For langage-guided editing:

`-f lseg` with `NUM_SEMANTIC_CHANNELS` `512`*.

For segmentation tasks:

`-f lseg --speedup` with `NUM_SEMANTIC_CHANNELS` `256`, `NUMBER = 2`*.

`-f sam` with `NUM_SEMANTIC_CHANNELS` `256`.

`-f sam --speedup` with `NUM_SEMANTIC_CHANNELS` `128`, `NUMBER = 2`*.

*: setup used in our experiments
